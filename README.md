# Satellite Segmentation Model

## Overview

The Satellite Segmentation Model project focuses on semantic segmentation of satellite images using deep learning techniques.

## All the required setup is done in the notebook itself , just install the libraries as given in jupyter notebook



## Model

"satellite_segmentation_full.h5" this is the model you can load it using load_model library


## Model Training
The UNet model is trained using the model.fit() function with specified batch size, epochs, and validation data.

Evaluation and Visualization
----------------------------

* Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and Jaccard index are computed during training and saved for analysis.
* Visualizations of input images, ground truth masks, and segmented outputs are generated for qualitative assessment.
